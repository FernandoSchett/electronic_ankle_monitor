## Special thanks to ü•∞:

- [Jo√£o Alberto Castelo Branco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo√£o-alberto-65b57729/), our mentor, your experience and knowledge have been invaluable to our progress.

## About ü§î:

This project was developed during the Microprocessors 1 course at SENAI CIMETC in 2023.1. Our main objective was to create an electronic ankle bracelet using the ESP32 board. While the initial idea was to incorporate GPS functionality, due to limited resources, we opted for a simulation-based approach using WiFi connectivity. The electronic ankle bracelet is still in its initial phase but shows great potential for future expansions, making it a viable solution for monitoring individuals, animals, or objects. In this project, we aimed to highlight the advantages, such as affordability, a simple user interface, and easy assembly process. We also aim to make an article obout our project, with the orientation from our teacher, [Jo√£o Alberto Castelo Branco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo√£o-alberto-65b57729/).

## How does it work üí°:

The electronic ankle bracelet will be connected to the Wi-Fi network of the monitoring location or the individual's home. When the person being monitored loses Wi-Fi connection, the ankle bracelet will emit a bright light and produce a loud sound. If the system detects a lack of response, it will automatically alert the authorities or the responsible parties. The project will prioritize usability, affordability, and minimal battery consumption. Furthermore, the ankle bracelet will be ergonomically designed, highly durable, and 3D printed to prevent easy removal. Another important aspect is the deactivation process. To deactivate the ankle bracelet, a series of buttons will need to be pressed in the correct order. All activity logs will be securely stored in a cloud-based system.

## Resourses üßë‚Äçüî¨:

- Wi-Fi Connectivity: The ankle bracelet will be connected to the Wi-Fi network for communication and monitoring purposes.

- Connection Loss Alerts: When the monitored individual loses Wi-Fi connection, the ankle bracelet will emit a strong light and produce a loud sound to grab attention.

- Activation of Authorities: If the system doesn't receive a response within a specific timeframe, it will trigger an alert to notify the authorities or responsible individuals.

- Usability: The project will prioritize user-friendliness, ensuring that the electronic ankle bracelet is accessible and easy to use for individuals.

- Affordable Pricing: A cost-effective approach will be pursued, aiming to make the project economically viable and accessible to a wider range of users.

- Minimal Battery Consumption: The ankle bracelet will be designed to optimize power consumption, providing an adequate battery life.

- Ergonomics and Durability: The electronic ankle bracelet will feature ergonomic design, offering comfort to the wearer while being resistant to impacts and adverse conditions.

- 3D Printing: Utilizing 3D printing technology, the ankle bracelet will benefit from customization, durability, and precise detailing.

- Secure Deactivation Process: A secure process will be implemented to deactivate the ankle bracelet, requiring a specific sequence of button presses to prevent unauthorized deactivations.

- Cloud-based Log Storage: All actions and events related to the ankle bracelet will be securely recorded and stored in a cloud-based system, allowing for a detailed activity history.

## How to run it üèÉ:

First, clone this repository. After that, connect the monitor at the computer, open the ```./src/anckle_monitor.cpp``` file at [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), then compile and load the program at ESP32 card.

## Development Process ‚öôÔ∏è:

Throughout the semester, in weekly classes the developers learned the basics of microprocessor programming using MSP430. We started with simple codes available in the ```./test_samples``` folder and, in the end, presented a functional prototype as our final project.
